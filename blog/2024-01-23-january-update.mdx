## January

- Boards and Other Components: **On the way**
    - Some vendors have already received the boards. Vendors are waiting on PCBs and the remaining components from KFA before shipping to customers. KFA is slated to receive their batch of Januarys this week.
- PCB Status: **In Progress**
    - PCBs are in production. Due to other projects being in the queue ahead of the January PCBs, they are expected to finish after the Chinese New Year.
