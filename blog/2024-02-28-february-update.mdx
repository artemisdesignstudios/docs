## February

- Boards and Other Components: **On the way**
    - Vendors have begun to QC their units. KFA plans to ship out the remaining components to the factory to be combined with the PCB orders by next Monday.
- PCB Status: **In Progress**
    - PCBs are in production. The factory has given us confirmation that production should be complete by the end of next week. Once they receive the accessory shipment, PCBs + accessories will be dispatched to each of the vendors.
