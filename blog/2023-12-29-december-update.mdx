## January

- Boards and Other Components: **Pending Shipment**
    - Some vendors have already received the boards. Vendors are waiting on PCBs and the remaining components from KFA before shipping to customers.
- PCB Status: **In Progress**
    - Prototypes have been verified by two separate parties and we have greenlit production. An ETA for PCB production will be provided shortly.

The January 2024 update can be expected sooner rather than later. Thank you for your patience and we hope you all have a great New Yearâ€™s.
