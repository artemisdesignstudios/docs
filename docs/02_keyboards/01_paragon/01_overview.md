## Description

The **Paragon** is a 75% gasket mount keyboard featuring a rotary encoder. The original design for the Paragon
began in June 2020, when keyboards such as the [Satisfaction75](https://cannonkeys.com/collections/satisfaction-75) and
the [GMMK Pro](https://www.gloriousgaming.com/products/glorious-gmmk-pro-75-barebone-black) were regarded as the most popular
offerings in the hobby.

The Paragon features an engraving of the skyline of San Francisco, with which we pay homage to the heart of the technology and software
industry, Silicon Valley.
