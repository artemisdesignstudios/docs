# Build Notes and Recommendations

We highly recommend considering these suggestions while building your January to ensure you can create the best typing experience for your preferences.

**Note:** To configure your PCB layout, please check out our [**guide**](/docs/Downloads/January/PCBs/via_pcb_configuration) on loading the PCB in VIA.

## TL;DR

- Use **clip-in** stabilizers.
- The January PCB is **1.6 mm** thick. **Use 1.6mm stabilizers** unless you are using a third-party 1.2 mm PCB.
- **Remove any shrinkwrap** on the JST cable and **align the cable** so it sits in the channel.
- Insert the plate and pcb assembly evenly.

## PCB

Hotswap and soldering PCBs (**1.6 mm**) were optional add-ons for the January. Set the PCB to your desired layout and test the PCB in VIA before assembling.

## O-Rings and Stabilizers

The January comes with a 50A durometer (M)edium-sized O-ring that is optimized for clip in stabilizers. To use screw in stabilizers, please purchase a (S)mall size o-ring.

## General Assembly Notes
Insert the plate and pcb assembly evenly as shown [**here**](https://youtu.be/-jxQMKH6k0c?si=w3ze1bXAudY1tmUv&t=548).
