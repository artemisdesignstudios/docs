## Description

The **January** is a 60% O-Ring mount keyboard featuring a copper weight and a sweeping side profile. The design of the
January came about as an experiment to test the accentuated side curves and rounded front and back edges, and it eventually
forked into its own project.

The January features a scripted engraving of its name on the copper weight, framed within an outline. The design on the weight was
done by kitkat.
