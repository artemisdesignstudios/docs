# Configuring your PCB through VIA

1. Download the zipped **VIA JSON configuration folder** for the January **[here](./via_files/january_via_config.zip)**. Unzip the zip file to view the `january_via_config.json` file.

2. Go to the **[VIA](https://usevia.app/)** website.

3. Click the **Authorize** button and select `January` from the pop-up dialogue that appears. Performing this action will not change the webpage.

4. Click on the **Settings** icon on the far left side of the header tab.

5. In the **Settings** tab, enable the `Show Design tab`.

6. Click on the `Load` icon and select the `january_via_config.json` file you previously downloaded. Upon loading the file, VIA will ask you to authorize the January PCB again.

7. You should now be able to head to the **Configure** tab and start manipulating the keymap for your PCB.
